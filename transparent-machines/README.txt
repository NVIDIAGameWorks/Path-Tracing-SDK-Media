PROJECT FILES:  To look EXACTLY like the final film, these files require R14 and Vray.  There are actually no lights or really anything else in the project besides the geometry.  The light is coming from the "environment" in the render settings, turn this off if you'd like to light it differently.  

***PLEASE NOTE***  -- If you don't have Vray, you can just delete those associated tags, and put it on a different renderer, use regular C4D materials and still render out the scene.  Vray is really just a different renderer/lighting/materials. It DOES NOT affect the actual geometry or animation and is not absolutely nessecary to use these project files. 


Any other questions, email me at winkelmm@gmail.com ;)  Have fun!!

CREATIVE COMMONS:
These files are available under a sort of "open source" concept. They are intended for educational use but really can be used for whatever the fuck you want. You don't need to credit me for whatever commercial or non-commercial use you make of them, but if you could shout me a holla with any project that does come from them, I'd love to see it :)

Also, if you want to know as soon as new projects are posted, follow me on Facebook or Twitter!
